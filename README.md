Online Supplementary Materials for Venables, C. 2016. Molecular Systematics of the Agabinae (Ph.D. Thesis)

## Repository Contents
Supplementary data and analysis files for chapters 2-5 each have their own directory. For chapters 2 & 4, subdirectories are included for each of the main analyses performed in that chapter (e.g., `./Chapter2/BAMM-Chpt2`). Each of these analysis subdirectories are self-contained working directories -- they contain all code and data files necessary to reproduce the analysis. 

## Citing the thesis
An official citation for Venables, C. 2016. Molecular Systematics of the Agabinae (Ph.D. Thesis) will become available after the final revision has been accepted by the thesis committee at the University of Calgary.
